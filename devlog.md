## Implementation Summary

This document describes the implementation of the lumin utility, focusing on design decisions, challenges encountered, and solutions applied.

## Core Features

### Search Functionality (`search/mod.rs`)
- **Description**: Searches for patterns in files using the `grep` crate
- **Key components**:
  - `SearchOptions`: Controls case sensitivity, gitignore respect, and context lines (before/after matches)
  - `SearchResult`: Contains matched file path, line number, content, and context indicators
  - `search_files()`: Main search function
  - `collect_files()`: Helper to gather files respecting gitignore settings

### Traverse Functionality (`traverse/mod.rs`)
- **Description**: Traverses directories and lists files using the `ignore` crate
- **Key components**:
  - `TraverseOptions`: Controls case sensitivity, gitignore respect, text-only filtering, and pattern matching
  - `TraverseResult`: Contains file path and file type
  - `is_hidden()`: Detects hidden files and files in hidden directories
  - `traverse_directory()`: Main directory traversal function
- **Pattern matching**:
  - Supports glob patterns (wildcards, character classes, brace expansion)
  - Supports substring patterns for simpler searches
  - Automatically selects appropriate matching strategy
  - Respects case sensitivity settings

### View Functionality (`view/mod.rs`)
- **Description**: Displays file contents with metadata using the `infer` crate
- **Key components**:
  - `ViewOptions`: Controls size limits and line filtering options
  - `FileView`: Structured output with file path, type, contents, and total line count
  - `FileContents`: Enum with variants for different types of content (text, binary, image)
  - `TextContent`: Container for line-by-line text content
  - `LineContent`: Represents a single line with number and content
  - `TextMetadata`, `BinaryMetadata`, `ImageMetadata`: Specialized metadata structures
  - `view_file()`: Main function for viewing files with optimized size checking

### CLI Interface (`main.rs`)
- **Description**: Command-line interface using the `clap` crate
- **Key components**:
  - `Cli`: Main CLI structure with subcommands
  - `Commands`: Enum of available commands (search, traverse, view)
  - Command-specific option handling

## Technical Considerations

### Error Handling
- Using `anyhow` crate for comprehensive error handling
- Context-rich error messages with `with_context` and `context` methods
- Proper propagation of errors using the `?` operator
- Early returns for validation errors

### File Type Detection
- Multi-layered approach to file type detection:
  1. Extension-based detection for common file types
  2. Content-based detection using the `infer` crate
  3. Heuristic text/binary detection as fallback
- Special handling for different file categories (text, image, binary)

### Gitignore Handling
- Comprehensive gitignore handling using the `ignore` crate
- Special attention to hidden files and directories
- Options to respect or ignore gitignore rules
- Proper handling of the `.hidden` builder flag (critical for test passing)

### Structured Type System
- Strong typing using enums and structs for different file content types
- Type-safe serialization using serde
- Clear separation of concerns between different file types (text, binary, image)

### Testing
- Comprehensive test suite with serial execution using `serial_test`
- Test setup/teardown using `TestEnvironment` with RAII pattern
- Tests for all edge cases:
  - Case sensitivity
  - Gitignore respect/ignore
  - Hidden files
  - Binary files
  - Size limits

## Challenges and Solutions

### Gitignore Handling
- **Challenge**: Proper handling of gitignore files, especially when toggling respect_gitignore flag
- **Solution**: 
  ```rust
  // When not respecting gitignore, explicitly include hidden files and dirs
  builder.hidden(options.respect_gitignore);
  // Additional settings to ensure we fully respect/ignore gitignore as needed
  if !options.respect_gitignore {
      builder.ignore(false); // Turn off all ignore logic
      builder.git_exclude(false); // Don't use git exclude files
      builder.git_global(false); // Don't use global git ignore
  }
  ```

### Hidden File Detection
- **Challenge**: Properly identifying files in hidden directories
- **Solution**: Enhanced the `is_hidden()` method to check both file name and path components:
  ```rust
  pub fn is_hidden(&self) -> bool {
      // Check if the file name starts with a dot
      let file_is_hidden = self.file_path
          .file_name()
          .and_then(|n| n.to_str())
          .is_some_and(|name| name.starts_with("."));
          
      // Also check if the file is in a hidden directory
      let path_contains_hidden_dir = self.file_path
          .to_string_lossy()
          .split('/')
          .any(|part| part.starts_with(".") && !part.is_empty());
          
      file_is_hidden || path_contains_hidden_dir
  }
  ```

### File Type Detection
- **Challenge**: Reliable detection of file types, especially distinguishing text and binary
- **Solution**: Multi-layered approach combining extension hints and content analysis:
  ```rust
  // First try extension-based detection
  let extension_type = path
      .extension()
      .and_then(|ext| ext.to_str())
      .map(|ext| match ext.to_lowercase().as_str() {
          "txt" | "md" | "rs" | "toml" => Some("text/plain"),
          // ... more extensions ...
          _ => None
      })
      .unwrap_or(None);
      
  // Then try content-based detection with fallbacks
  let file_type = match infer.get_from_path(path) {
      Ok(Some(kind)) => kind.mime_type().to_string(),
      Ok(None) => {
          if let Some(ext_type) = extension_type {
              ext_type.to_string()
          } else {
              // Heuristic analysis as last resort
              // ...
          }
      },
      Err(e) => return Err(anyhow!("Failed to determine file type: {}", e)),
  };
  ```

### Type-Safe Output Structure
- **Challenge**: Creating a type-safe yet flexible structure for file contents
- **Solution**: Replaced dynamic JSON with a strongly typed enum structure:
  ```rust
  #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug, Clone)]
  #[serde(tag = "type")]
  pub enum FileContents {
      #[serde(rename = "text")]
      Text {
          content: String,
          metadata: TextMetadata,
      },
      #[serde(rename = "binary")]
      Binary {
          message: String,
          metadata: BinaryMetadata,
      },
      #[serde(rename = "image")]
      Image {
          message: String,
          metadata: ImageMetadata,
      },
  }
  
  #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug, Clone)]
  pub struct TextMetadata {
      pub line_count: usize,
      pub char_count: usize,
  }
  
  #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug, Clone)]
  pub struct BinaryMetadata {
      pub binary: bool,
      pub size_bytes: u64,
      pub mime_type: Option<String>,
  }
  ```

### Test Pattern Matching
- **Challenge**: Making tests work with enum-based content types instead of direct JSON access
- **Solution**: Updated tests to use Rust's pattern matching:
  ```rust
  match &result.contents {
      FileContents::Text { content, metadata } => {
          assert!(!content.is_empty());
          assert!(content.contains("Configuration file for testing"));
          assert!(metadata.line_count > 0);
          assert!(metadata.char_count > 0);
      },
      _ => panic!("Expected text content, got a different variant"),
  }
  ```
